Hi, I'm currently a Ph.D. student working with Prof. [Felix Xiaozhu Lin](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~xzl/) and other awesome folks at [XSEL](http://xsel.rocks), School of Electric and Computer Engineering, Purdue University. 
My past projects span from **kernel**, **driver**, to **binary translation** and other userland approaches. 
I'm particularly intrigued by the complexity of computer systems and the endeavour of builting them.

Besides research, I enjoy: 
1.	Playing video games since it ignited my passion for computer since I was 6. (was a Diamond level player in [Legue of Legends](), now a Plat player in [Overwatch]()).
2.	Phtography. Check out my (*awsome*) photos [here](placeholder).
3.	Music.
