Hi, I'm currently a Ph.D. student working with Prof. [Felix Xiaozhu Lin](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~xzl/) and other awesome folks at [XSEL](http://xsel.rocks), School of Electric and Computer Engineering, Purdue University. 
I'm particularly intrigued by the complexity of computer systems and the endeavour of building them. 

My past and ongoing projects span multiple aspects of **kernel**, including **drivers** that provide energy isolation, **file systems** that are highly secure on IoT devices, to **dynamic binary translation** that run a wimpy peeripheral cores.

# A Little Bit More
Besides research, I mostly enjoy: 
*	Playing video games which ignited my original passion for computers since I was six
(Diamond in [Legue of Legends](), Platinum in [Overwatch]()).
Check out my game clips [here](placeholder)!
*	Phtography. I record my life by shooting photos. Check out my (*awsome*) photos [here](placeholder)!
