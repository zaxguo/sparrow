Hi, I'm currently a Ph.D. student working with Prof. [Felix Xiaozhu Lin](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~xzl/) and other awesome folks at [XSEL](http://xsel.rocks), School of Electric and Computer Engineering, Purdue University. 

My past projects span from **kernel**, **driver**, to **binary translation** and other userland approaches. 
I'm particularly intrigued by the complexity of computer systems and the endeavour of building them.

# A Little Bit More
Besides research, I mostly enjoy: 
*	Playing video games which ignited my original passion for computers since I was six
(Diamond in [Legue of Legends](), Platinum in [Overwatch]()).
Check out my game clips [here](placeholder)!
*	Phtography. I record my life by shooting photos. Check out my (*awsome*) photos [here](placeholder)!
